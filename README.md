# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis<br>

## Context <br>
The objective of this task is to detect hate speech in tweets. For the sake of simplicity, we say a tweet contains hate speech if it has a racist or sexist sentiment associated with it. So, the task is to classify racist or sexist tweets from other tweets. <br>
Formally, given a training sample of tweets and labels, where label '1' denotes the tweet is racist/sexist and label '0' denotes the tweet is not racist/sexist, your objective is to predict the labels on the test dataset.<br>

## Dataset Information <br>
train.csv - Training model has a labelled dataset of 31,962 tweets. The dataset is provided in the form of a csv file with each line storing a tweet id, its label and the tweet.<br>
test_tweets.csv - The test data file contains only tweet ids and the tweet text with each tweet in a new line.<br>
